# TikTern
A web3, socialfi and gamefi decentralised economy

Introduction: 

According to a world bank report, more than 4 billion inhabitants, about 55% of the world's population, live in cities. It is estimated that by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will live in cities. Urban life today has its challenges - 
1. Rise in large vehicular traffic, leading to congestion on roads
2. CO2 emissions leading to poor air quality and climate change
3. Growing sedentary lifestyles

The movement to build sustainable lifestyles and living spaces is gaining momentum globally. Modern city planning is all about non polluting vehicles for mobility and bikes/ebikes are at the center of it. The key is to make biking part of everyone’s everyday life and that requires taking biking to non-cycling users. There are various riding apps (web 2.0) that are built for cycling enthusiasts and do a good job offering features to track cycling activity. However, they inherently are not designed to attract or incentivise non-cycling enthusiasts to get on to bikes/ebikes. The purpose of TikTern is to encourage more and more people to get on bikes/ebikes in a bid to build sustainable living spaces and healthy lifestyles. By incentivising people (with platform-native Tokens) to use bikes/ebikes whenever possible, TikTern aims to reduce car usage, tackle emissions and make biking a way of life. Unlike other riding apps that monetise what Riders create, TikTern lets Riders decide and take any earnings with them. TikTern’s a decentralised social platform for cycling, with rich collaborative features and metaverse in development. It is purpose-built with the riders at the center, giving them complete control of the content they create and allowing them to fully benefit from any monetisation of it.
